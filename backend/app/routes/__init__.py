from flask import Blueprint

# This file can be used to initialize blueprints or import them for easier registration

# Example (these will be defined in their respective files):
# from .auth import bp_auth
# from .words import bp_words
# from .records import bp_records

# It's also common to define blueprints directly in their modules and import them in app/__init__.py
